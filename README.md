# Python-ML_Project
This project builds a decision model using Python and machine learning techniques to predict house prices based on diverse parameters such as location, age, rooms, and other relevant features. The model is trained on historical housing data to learn patterns and estimate prices for new inputs, supporting informed decisions in real estate markets.

Features
Data Collection and Processing: Integrates a curated housing dataset, exploring features like property age, rooms, income, and population. Includes robust data preprocessing and cleaning workflows.

Exploratory Analysis: Presents visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, correlation matrices) to understand feature relationships and data distributions.

Model Building: Trains a regression model (e.g., Decision Tree, Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting) using Scikit-learn and XGBoost, evaluating performance with standard metrics like RÂ² and Mean Absolute Error.

Prediction Interface: Enables users to input property features and receive predicted pricing.

Performance Evaluation: Assesses model quality using test data, visualizes prediction vs. actual prices, and communicates accuracy statistics.

Extensible Codebase: Organized for easy extension, covering scripts for data loading, preprocessing, training, and inference.
